Just a place to keep my resume up-to-date.

## Goals

The same code should look good...
1. In browser
2. On mobile
3. In Print/PDF

## TODO:

- Replace current SCSS build process (a la Gulp) with ParcelJS
- Figure out conditional headers on long-secion page-breaks to present something like "Foo Bar Cont'd" for section "Foo Bar"
